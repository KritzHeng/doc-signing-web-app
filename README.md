# Document Signer App

Document Signing with Signify Browser Extension.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001/doc-signer](http://localhost:3001/doc-signer) with your browser to view the app. 

__Note__:  `/doc-signer` is required as path because [basePath option](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath) is set in `next.config.js`.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
